# Image-data-convert-into-JSON
Project Overview
The Image Data to JSON Conversion project aims to convert image data into a structured JSON format. By leveraging Gemini, a powerful AI model developed by Google (or any custom Gemini-based tool you're working with), this project extracts features from images and stores them in a machine-readable JSON format, which can be used for various applications, such as machine learning, image classification, or data analysis.
This project will help automate the process of converting images into meaningful metadata or features, such as image labels, pixel data, and other relevant details, making it easier to handle large datasets.

# Features
Converts image data into structured JSON format.
Supports various image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
Uses Gemini AI to analyze and extract features from images.
Outputs JSON containing image metadata such as labels, dimensions, color information, etc.
Easily extensible for adding additional features or formats.

# Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
Python 3.6+
Gemini (Google's generative AI model) â€” Make sure you have access to the Gemini API or SDK.
Other Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt).
